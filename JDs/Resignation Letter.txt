Dear Mr.Toan,
I am writing to formally resign from my position as a Software Developer at NashTech, effective as soon as possible from today.
I have enjoyed working at NashTech and am grateful for the opportunities and support provided during my tenure.
My experience here has been invaluable, and I have had the pleasure of working with a talented and supportive team.
However, after careful consideration, I have decided to pursue a new opportunity that aligns more closely with my career aspirations and personal goals.
This decision was not easy, as I have genuinely enjoyed my time here and hold the company in high regard.
I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will do my best to complete any pending tasks and assist in transferring my responsibilities.
Please let me know how I can help during this period to facilitate a seamless handover.
I wish NashTech continued success and hope to stay in touch with you and my colleagues. 
Thank you once again for the support and opportunities you have provided me.
Sincerely,
Vuong Dang
