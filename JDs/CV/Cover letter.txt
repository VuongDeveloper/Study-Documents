Dear Mr/Ms,

Your post for Java Dev on the TopDev website caught my eye, and as I appear to be a suitable match for this position, I am eagerly applying for the vacancy.
I have been a Java Developer for about 2 years since 2022.Â 
I am quite experienced in working with Java SE, and Spring Framework Ecosystem (Spring Boot, Spring Security,...). Besides, I have several years of experience as a Maths in English teacher, so I can communicate fluently in English, as well as read any English documents without any difficulty.
I hope to work in your bank as a way to sharpen my skills as a Java Developer, my working experience in a bank system, and also earn a living. My curriculum vitae is attached and I look forward to being able to discuss the position with you further

Best Regards,

Vuong Dang
